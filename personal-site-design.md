<h3>What is your site's primary purpose?</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of my site in this moment is to fulfil requirements for phase zero. it serves as a "showcase" of homework assignments and newly acquired skills.</p>
<h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
<p>At this time, my target audience would be my teachers and my collegues.</p>
<h3>How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?</h3>
<p>I would like the experience to be easy to navigate and maybe gentle on the eyes. If it can provide some humour, that would be a nice touch but at this point it is mostly function and process driven. I like to create interactive environments so it would be lovely to keep a guest occupied however I am not sure it is within my scope of capabilities at present.</p>
<h3>How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?</h3>
<p>By investigating! By implementing! and by having fun with experimenting!
